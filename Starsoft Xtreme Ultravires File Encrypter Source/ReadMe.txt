To enter a key, all character are allowed. We recommand at least 6 character. As you enter the key you can see the key quality below. Longer keys or using small and capital chars, together with signs, will provide higher security. Key that use only one sign (for example: AAAAA) or keys, smaller than three signs are not allowed.

Once encrypted the file will have the extension ucc and the original extension is included in the encrypted file. Without the key the original filetype cannot be retrieved.

-------------------------------------------------------
     1.6 Known problems
-------------------------------------------------------

Using ULTRAVIRES Files to encrypt or decrypt files can cause problems when the filesize exceeds the CPU's available memory, resulting in extreme slow proccessing due file swapping or even program lockup. This is due to the fact that the file needs to be loaded entirely for proccessing. These problems does not occure when creating USD's because they are continuesley loading and saving the data to another target during file proccessing.
